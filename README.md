# Web-Scrapping using Beautifulsoup

This project was developed as one of the pinnacle projects of the Algoritma Academy Data Analysis Specialization. The expected deliverable of this project is to do a simple web scraping to get information. We'll also be using a simple pumpkin dashboard to display our memo and visualization results.

## Dependencies

In this Capstone Project, I choose the problem from 

- Data kurs US Dollar ke rupiah dari `https://www.exchange-rates.org/history/IDR/USD/T`
    * From that page search for `daily price`, and `date`
    * Make a plot of the movement of the USD exchange rate
